# PHAS0077-Individual-Research-Project

It is 2023 now and I think it is time to try to optimise the project a bit. I think I may need some time to re-read this project first, as it has been a long time... There are several points that I would like to have a try on optimising this project just using the existing resources, let's see if these actions could benefit the model.

**TODO** The first point might be rearrange the packages I have used, as I think sklearn may could be reduced.
**TODO** The second point might be play around a little bit with the data, some data preprocessing might be useful on the model.

Dependency:
  a python 3.8 environment is needed, besides, the code of this project depends on several packages:
    1. TensorFlow2
    2. numpy
    3. matplotlib 
    4. scipy 
    5. sklearn
  
  
Executing instruction:
  to run the code, put the 'barrier.dat' and 'ligands.desc' in the same directory with the 'ml_with_tf_final.py' file, then the python file could be executed
